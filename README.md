# Notes:
1. Took way too long to remember how Route and Link worked. Wish I figured it out sooner, it's so much more easy to figure out then the display:none and passing of the state nonsense I was overcomplicated things with.
2. Updated links to open new tabs instead of opening the links on same tab.
3. Updated to change favicon icon to initals (so it's not just base react icon)
