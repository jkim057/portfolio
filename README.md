# Notes:
1. Took way too long to remember how Route and Link worked. Wish I figured it out sooner, it's so much more easy to figure out then the display:none and passing of the state nonsense I was overcomplicated things with.
2. Updated links to open new tabs instead of opening the links on same tab.
3. Updated to change favicon icon to initals (so it's not just base react icon)
4. Trying to figure out if I can just import files or if I should just start with the template from the getgo




# Future plans:
## Short term:
1. Plan is to change about page to homepage.
Need to: 
* Change about tab from last position to front position.
* Change about tab name to home page.
* Welcome info needs to be located only on homepage
* contact information needs to be moved to bottom of page.
* Should contact info be available on every page or just home page?

2. Set up bottom tag to list contact links

3. The spacing and layout feels off. The title on each page + how the information gets laid out doesn't feel good. 

## Long term:
1. Change website template to look more clean.
